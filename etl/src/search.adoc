== Search strategy

* Search is performed by strictly increasing the search token * alphabetically.
* To optimize search, we use the suggestions of the search result.
* If we can leverage the suggestions we call this a "jump".
* We can leverage the suggestions if the search token is a prefix of at least one of the suggestions.
* A jump is registered with the previous search token.
* Jumps are searched to exhaustion, i.e. until the jump string ends in `z`.
* After we exhaust the jump, we jump back to the previous search token.
* From there we increment the search token and repeat the process.
To avoid clashes with previous jumps we skip any jumps ahead.
* It is possible to jump ahead multiple times.
